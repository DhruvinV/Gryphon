# Examples

This folder stores the example applications whose model has been successfully translated. Each example includes:

- A Swift version of the app, used as the source of the translation. This version's had its model  adapted to only use features that can be translated by Gryphon wherever possible, and to insert manual translations otherwise.
- A Kotlin version of the app, used as the "destination" of the translation. The swift files from the application above get translated by Gryphon and end up here.
- A `Readme` file, explaining some specific details of the translation and providing a link to the app that originated this example.
