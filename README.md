# Gryphon


Gryphon is (or rather, will be) a Swift to Kotlin translator. It is intended to generate correct Kotlin code, such that a user never has to manually edit the generated files. The code is also meant to be human readable, so that a user can stop using this compiler at any time and still have two fully maintainable codebases (one in Kotlin and one in Swift).

This is a highly unstable program for now, and anything can change at a moment's notice.
