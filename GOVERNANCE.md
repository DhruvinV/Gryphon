# Governance

## Basics

Vinícius Jorge Vendramini, the benevolent dictator for life (BDFL), holds ultimate decision-making power while seeking to represent a balance of the views and the best interests of the community as a whole.

## Participants

Participation is open to anyone who wants to join.

The BDFL can remove misbehaving participants at will for the sake of the common good.

In the event that the BDFL is unable or unwilling to continue leadership, the BDFL may appoint a new BDFL or choose to alter the governance structure entirely.

## Policy

The BDFL sets the community's policies and makes decisions for the community, taking reasonable account of input from other community participants.

The BDFL is responsible for implementing—or delegating implementation of—policies and other decisions.

If participants are not happy with the BDFL's leadership they are encouraged to voice their concerns, and are free or leave the community.

## Process

Community participants are free to discuss and debate community policies, practices, and culture.

## Evolution

The BDFL can change the governance structure of the community at will.
